title: Deposit NFTs using Ronin Bridge
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to deposit an NFT (non-fungible token) from an Ethereum address into your Ronin Wallet using Ronin Bridge.

## Prerequisites

[Ronin Wallet](wallet.roninchain.com)

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit NFTs** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect the Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the NFT from.
3. In the **To** field, enter the Ronin address of the wallet that you want to deposit the NFT into.

## Step 2. Select the NFT to deposit

1. Choose the collection containing the NFTs you want to deposit.
2. In the collection, select the specific NFT you want to transfer.

## Step 3. Approve the deposit

Before depositing an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it. You have two options for approval: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

* Single token: If you're only depositing one NFT, you can grant permission to just this token. Select the NFT you want to transfer, click **Approve**, and then select **Single token**. When you make another transfer next time, you will need to approve it in the same way.
* All tokens: You can choose to grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future. Select the NFT you want to transfer, then click **Approve**, and then select **All tokens**. After this, your further transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Deposit the NFT

1. To deposit your NFT, click **Send**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the deposit. If everything looks correct, click **Confirm**. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 5. Receive the NFT on Ronin

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you should be able to see the NFT in your Ronin Wallet shortly. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.
