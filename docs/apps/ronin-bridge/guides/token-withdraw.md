title: Withdraw ERC20 tokens
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to withdraw an ERC20 token from your Ronin Wallet to an address on Ethereum. The supported tokens include ETH, AXS, SLP, USDC, AGG, and АЕС.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Withdraw** tab.
2. Connect your Ronin Wallet using the browser extension or mobile app for your device. When done, you can see your Ronin address in the **From** field as the sender of the token.
3. In the **To** field, enter the Ethereum address that you want to transfer the token to.

Double-check the recipient address to avoid sending your tokens to the wrong destination.

## Step 2. Select the token and amount

1. Choose the ERC20 token that you want to withdraw.
2. Enter the withdrawal amount manually or select **Max** to withdraw the entire balance of this token available in your wallet.

## Step 3. Confirm the withdrawal

1. To withdraw your tokens, select **Submit withdrawal**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the withdrawal. If everything looks correct, select **Confirm**. Make sure you have enough RON in your Ronin Wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 4. Receive your tokens on Ethereum

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you can check the wallet that you use with the specified Ethereum address to verify that the tokens have arrived successfully. Be patient, as transactions can sometimes take several minutes to complete, depending on network congestion and transaction fees.
