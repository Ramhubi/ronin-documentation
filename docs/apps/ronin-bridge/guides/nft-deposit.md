## Overview

This guide describes how to deposit an NFT (non-fungible token) from your Ethereum wallet into your address on the Ronin chain. The supported NFT collections include Pixels FarmLand, Cyberkongz VX, and Cyberkongz Genkai.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit NFTs** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect your Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the NFT from. The supported wallets include Metamask and Trust Wallet.
3. In the **To** field, enter your Ronin address that you want to deposit the NFT into.

## Step 2. Select the NFT to deposit

1. Choose the collection containing the NFTs you want to deposit.
2. In the collection, select the specific NFT.

## Step 3. Authorize the bridge to transfer your NFT

To deposit an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it, which is also referred to as *approval*. You have two ways to do it: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

* Single token: If you're only depositing one NFT, you can grant permission to just this token. Select the NFT you want to transfer, select **Approve**, and then select **Single token**. When you make another transfer next time, you will need to approve it in the same way.
* All tokens: You can choose to grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future. Select the NFT you want to transfer, then select **Approve**, and then select **All tokens**. After this, your further transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Deposit your NFT

1. To deposit your NFT, select **Send**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the deposit. If everything looks correct, select **Confirm** in your connected wallet. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 5. Receive your NFT in Ronin Wallet

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you should be able to see the NFT in your Ronin Wallet. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.
