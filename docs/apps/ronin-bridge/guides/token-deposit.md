---

## Overview

This guide describes how to deposit an ERC20 token from your Ethereum wallet into your address on the Ronin chain. The supported tokens include ETH, AXS, SLP, USDC, AGG, and АЕС.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Deposit** tab.
2. In the **From** field, connect your Ethereum wallet that you want to transfer the token from. The supported wallets include Metamask and Trust Wallet.
3. In the **To** field, enter your Ronin address that you want to deposit the token into.

## Step 2. Select the token and amount

1. Choose the ERC20 token that you want to deposit.
2. Enter the deposit amount manually or select **Max** to deposit the entire balance of this token available in your wallet.

## Step 3. Confirm the deposit

1. To deposit your tokens, select **Send**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the deposit. If everything looks correct, select **Confirm** in your connected wallet. Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 4. Receive your tokens in Ronin Wallet

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you should be able to see the tokens in your Ronin Wallet. Be patient, however, as transactions can take some time to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.
