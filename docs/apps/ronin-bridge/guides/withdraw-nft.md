title: Withdraw NFTs from Ronin Walelt using Ronin Bridge
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to withdraw an NFT (non-fungible token) from your Ronin Wallet to an Ethereum address using Ronin Bridge.

## Prerequisites

[Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com)

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Withdraw NFTs** tab.
2. Connect your Ronin Wallet using the browser extension or mobile app for your device. When done, your Ronin address displays in the **From** field as the address you want to withdraw the NFT from.
3. In the **To** field, enter the Ethereum address of the wallet you want to transfer the NFT to.

Double-check the recipient address to avoid sending your NFT to the wrong destination.

## Step 2. Select the NFT to withdraw

1. Choose the collection containing the NFTs you want to withdraw.
2. In the collection, select the specific NFT you want to transfer.

## Step 3. Approve the withdrawal

Before withdrawing an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it. You have two options for approval: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

* Single token: If you're only withdrawing one NFT, you can grant permission to just this token. Select the NFT you want to transfer, click **Approve**, and then select **Single token**. When you make another transfer next time, you will need to approve it in the same way.
* All tokens: You can choose to grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future. Select the NFT you want to transfer, then click **Approve**, and then select **All tokens**. After this, your further transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Withdraw the NFT

1. To withdraw your NFT, click **Submit withdrawal**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the gas fees associated with the withdrawal. If everything looks correct, click **Confirm**. Make sure you have enough RON in your Ronin Wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 5. Verify NFT receipt

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you can check your connected Ethereum wallet to verify that the NFT has arrived successfully. Be patient, as Ethereum transactions can sometimes take several minutes to complete, depending on network congestion and gas fees.
