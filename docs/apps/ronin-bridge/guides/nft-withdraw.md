## Overview

This guide describes how to withdraw an NFT (non-fungible token) from your Ronin Wallet to an address on Ethereum. The supported NFT collections include Pixels FarmLand, Cyberkongz VX, and Cyberkongz Genkai.

## Prerequisites

* An address on Ronin and the [Ronin Wallet](https://wallet.roninchain.com) extension or mobile app.
* An address on Ethereum and a wallet linked to it, such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Step 1. Fill in the details

1. Open the [Ronin Bridge](https://app.roninchain.com/bridge) app and select the **Withdraw NFTs** tab.
2. Connect your Ronin Wallet using the browser extension or mobile app for your device. When done, you can see your Ronin address in the **From** field as the sender of the NFT.
3. In the **To** field, enter the Ethereum address that you want to transfer the NFT to.

Double-check the recipient address to avoid sending your NFT to the wrong destination.

## Step 2. Select the NFT to withdraw

1. Choose the collection containing the NFTs you want to withdraw.
2. In the collection, select the specific NFT you want to transfer.

## Step 3. Authorize the bridge to transfer your NFT

To withdraw an NFT, you need to grant Ronin Bridge permission to transfer it, which is also referred to as *approval*. You have two ways to do it: approve a single token or approve all tokens.

* Single token: If you're only withdrawing one NFT, you can grant permission to just this token. Select the NFT you want to transfer, click **Approve**, and then select **Single token**. When you make another transfer next time, you will need to approve it in the same way.
* All tokens: You can choose to grant access to all your tokens at once to bypass the single token approval step in the future. Select the NFT you want to transfer, then click **Approve**, and then select **All tokens**. After this, your further transfers will not require approvals.

## Step 4. Withdraw your NFT

1. To withdraw your NFT, click **Submit withdrawal**.
2. Review the transaction details, including the fees associated with the withdrawal. If everything looks correct, click **Confirm**. Make sure you have enough RON in your Ronin Wallet to cover the fees.

## Step 5. Receive your NFT on Ethereum

After the transaction is confirmed by the network, you can check the wallet that you use with the specified Ethereum address to verify that the NFT has arrived successfully. Be patient, as transactions can sometimes take several minutes to complete, depending on network congestion and transaction fees.
